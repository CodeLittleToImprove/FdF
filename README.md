# FdF
FdF is a 42 project that explores the fundamentals of computer graphics and 3D representation using the wireframe technique. The program takes a map file as input, where each number represents a point in a grid. It then generates a 3D representation of the map using the simple concept of connecting these points with lines, creating a visual representation of the terrain.
